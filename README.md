Introduction to the Problem

This code deals with the analysis of data on symptoms of the Covid-19 virus and the prediction of the severity of those symptoms in elderly individuals (aged 60+ years). The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has affected millions of people worldwide. Identifying and monitoring symptoms in infected individuals plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating the disease.

1.2 Problem Description

The aim of this code is to provide insight into COVID-19 symptoms and their correlation with disease severity. Using a dataset containing information on symptoms, contacts, and other demographic factors, this code analyzes and predicts the severity of symptoms. Through the process of data cleaning, visualization, and application of neural networks, the code aims to identify key factors influencing symptom severity and provide a predictive model for assessing symptom severity based on available data. This code can be useful in understanding and managing the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as providing guidelines for diagnosing and treating affected individuals.

Problem Solution
2.1 Method and Library Selection

This code uses a combination of libraries and methods for data analysis, visualization, and neural network construction. Here's a brief overview of method and library selection:
Libraries: NumPy is used for working with numerical data and matrices, essential for data manipulation and neural network construction. Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib are used for data visualization, displaying histograms, heatmaps, graphs, and scatter plots. Scikit-learn is used for splitting data into training and testing sets, evaluating model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as implementing a confusion matrix. TensorFlow and Keras are used for building and training a neural network to predict symptom severity.
Functions:
Data Cleaning: Data is loaded from a CSV file using the Pandas library, then unnecessary columns irrelevant to the analysis are removed.
Data Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries are used to display histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots to gain a better understanding of data distribution.
Data Splitting: Scikit-learn library is used to split data into training and testing sets to enable model validation.
Neural Network Construction: The Keras library, part of the TensorFlow ecosystem, is used to build a sequential neural network model with dense layers. The "relu" activation function is used to activate neurons in the hidden layers, while "softmax" is used for the output layer to predict symptom severity.
Model Training Method: The neural network is trained on the training set using the "adam" optimizer and "sparse_categorical_crossentropy" loss. Evaluation of Performance: The Scikit-learn library is again used to evaluate model performance on the testing set, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as displaying a confusion matrix.

Data Cleaning and Visualization
In terms of data cleaning and visualization, here are additional details about these parts of the code:
Data Cleaning: The Pandas library is used for data cleaning. After loading data from the CSV file into a DataFrame object, the drop method is applied to remove columns not needed for analysis. This step frees up unnecessary resources and focuses on relevant symptom and disease severity characteristics. This data cleaning step ensures more efficient and accurate analysis.
Data Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries are used for data visualization. Various functions and plots such as heatmap, hist, and displot are used to visualize symptom distribution, severity, and predictions. These visualizations provide an intuitive representation of data and enable quick understanding of distribution and relationships between different variables. Visualization helps identify trends, anomalies, and potential correlations among data.
Heatmap: The heatmap function from the Seaborn library is used to display a heatmap that visually represents the presence or absence of missing values (NaN) within the DataFrame. This visualization allows for a quick overview of potential missing data and helps identify areas that require further attention.
Histograms: The hist function from the Pandas library is used to display histograms for all numerical columns in the DataFrame. Histograms show the distribution of data for each numerical variable, providing insight into their distribution and characteristics. This is particularly useful for understanding the diversity of symptoms and disease severity.
Scatter Plot: The displot and kdeplot functions from the Seaborn library are used to display the distribution of symptom severity predictions relative to actual symptom severity. Scatter plots allow for a visual assessment of the correlation between predictions and actual values, aiding in model performance evaluation and understanding its strengths and limitations.
These data cleaning and visualization techniques provide deeper understanding of the data, facilitate pattern and trend identification, and aid in model performance evaluation.

Data Preparation
Dataset Splitting: After data cleaning, the train_test_split function from the Scikit-learn library is used to split the data into training and testing sets. This function enables splitting the data into two parts, where one part is used for model training (training set) and the other part is used for evaluating model performance (testing set). This is important to check the model's ability to generalize learned patterns to new, unseen data.

Separation of Input and Output Data: After splitting the dataset, indexing of the DataFrame object is used to separate input (X) and output (Y) data for model training and evaluation. Input data (X) represent symptom characteristics (e.g., age, gender) used to predict symptom severity. Output data (Y) represent the target variable we want to predict (severity of symptoms).

Defining the Neural Network Model
Sequential Model: Your code uses a sequential model in Keras. The sequential model is a basic model in Keras consisting of a sequence of layers connected one after the other. This is the simplest type of model and is good for most basic scenarios.
Dense Layers: Your code uses dense layers in the neural network. The dense layer is a basic layer in neural networks where each neuron receives input from all neurons in the previous layer. The number of neurons in the layer and the activation function applied to the layer's output are defined. Your code uses the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks for its simplicity and efficiency.
Softmax Layer: At the end of the neural network in your code, a softmax layer is used. The softmax layer is often used in multi-class classification problems as it converts the outputs of the neural network into probabilities for each class. The softmax function normalizes output values so that the sum of all outputs is 1, allowing interpretation of outputs as probabilities for each class.
Model Compilation: Before the model can be trained, it must be compiled with the appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics for performance evaluation. Your code uses the "adam" optimizer, a popular optimizer based on adaptive gradient descent. The "sparse_categorical_crossentropy" loss function is used, which is often used in multi-class classification problems. The "accuracy" metric is used for model evaluation.
Model Training: After compilation, the model is trained on the training set using the fit function. The fit function defines the number of epochs (iterations) to be performed during training, as well as the batch size used for optimization. During training, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize the loss function and improve performance.

Performance Measurement and Result Presentation
Prediction: After training the model, the predict function is used to make predictions on the test dataset. The predict function takes input data and generates predictions for output values.
Performance Measurement: After predictions are made, a set of metrics is used to measure the model's performance. Your code uses metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. These metrics provide information about the accuracy, the model's ability to find positive instances, and the combination of precision and recall. Using these metrics allows assessment of the model's performance in classification.
Result Presentation: To visually present the results, several functions and libraries are used. For example, the confusion_matrix function from the Scikit-learn library generates a confusion matrix, which displays the number of true and false predictions for each class. This matrix can be displayed using the ConfusionMatrixDisplay function from the Scikit-learn library.
Presenting results can be further enriched by using data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. For example, in your code, the hist function from the Matplotlib library and the displot function from the Seaborn library are used to display histograms of data distribution and scatter plots of predictions relative to symptom severity.
Additionally, the classification_report function from the Scikit-learn library is used to generate a detailed classification report. This report contains precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics for assessing model performance. This provides a detailed insight into the model's accuracy by class and overall performance.
All these methods and functions are useful for evaluating model performance and presenting results to draw conclusions about the model's effectiveness and reliability.
